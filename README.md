# CSAlgs - my examples of implementation some basic computer science algorithms by .NET
##Sorting
* Inserting sort - super basic sort algorithm with complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Shell sort - improved version of "Inserting sort", which allow to decrease complexity to O(n<sup>7/6</sup>) in good cases, but still O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst one.
* Quick sort - also called "Partition sort", which sorting elements by repeat dividing into two parts by pivot element. Normal complexity O(n lg n), but in worst case could be O(n<sup>2</sup>)
* Merge sort - not in place algorithm. Normal complexity O(n lg n)

##Search
* Binary search - basic search algorithm for sorted array, with complexity O(log n)

##Misc
* Create Stack from 2 queues
* Create Queue from 2 stacks

## Structures
* Added example of implmenetation one direction Linked List
